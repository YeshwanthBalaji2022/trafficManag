\subsection{Traditional Traffic Management Systems}

Traffic management has evolved significantly over the past several decades. Early systems relied on simple time-based controllers that operated on fixed schedules regardless of traffic conditions. Koonce and Rodegerdts provide a comprehensive overview of traditional traffic signal timing methodologies, highlighting the limitations of static timing patterns in dynamic urban environments.

Inductive loop detectors, introduced in the 1960s, represented the first generation of traffic-responsive systems. However, these ground-based sensors provide limited spatial coverage and require significant infrastructure investment. Chen et al. conducted a systematic review of traditional traffic detection technologies, identifying key limitations including high installation costs, maintenance requirements, and limited detection capabilities.

\subsection{Computer Vision in Traffic Management}

\section{Dataset}

\subsection{Data Collection Methodology}

The dataset for this project comprises multiple components designed to comprehensively evaluate the traffic management system under various conditions. The primary data source consists of aerial video footage captured from multiple traffic junctions, supplemented by synthetic data generated using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) software.

\subsection{Aerial Video Dataset}

The aerial video dataset contains approximately 35,000 frames captured from four distinct traffic junctions, each representing different traffic patterns and camera orientations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Junction normal\_01:} Standard four-way intersection with conventional camera positioning
\item \textbf{Junction normal\_02:} Similar configuration to normal\_01 with different traffic volume patterns
\item \textbf{Junction flipped\_03:} Four-way intersection with inverted camera orientation requiring geometric transformations
\item \textbf{Junction flipped\_04:} Complex intersection with irregular traffic patterns and varied lighting conditions
\end{itemize}

Each video segment spans 30 minutes of traffic activity, captured at 30 frames per second with 1920x1080 resolution. The footage includes various weather conditions (clear, overcast, light rain) and lighting scenarios (daylight, twilight, artificial illumination) to ensure robust model performance.

\subsection{Ground Truth Annotation}

Vehicle detection ground truth was established through manual annotation of representative frame samples. A team of three annotators independently labeled vehicle positions using bounding box annotations, with final labels determined through majority voting to ensure consistency. The annotation process covered:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vehicle type classification (car, truck, bus, motorcycle)
\item Directional movement annotation (north, east, south, west)
\item Occlusion and visibility scoring
\item Traffic density categorization (light, moderate, heavy)
\end{itemize}

Inter-annotator agreement was measured using Cohen's kappa coefficient, achieving an average score of 0.89, indicating high annotation reliability.

\subsection{SUMO Simulation Data}

To supplement real-world data and enable controlled experimentation, we utilized SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to generate synthetic traffic scenarios. The simulation environment includes:

\begin{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Architecture}

The intelligent traffic management system employs a microservices architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and real-time performance. The system is structured into three primary components: the computer vision detection service, the main application backend, and the React.js frontend interface.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/admin/Screenshot 2025-10-07 at 11.29.39 AM.png}
\caption{System Architecture Overview showing microservices communication pattern}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the overall system architecture, demonstrating the separation of concerns between detection services, application logic, and user interfaces.

\subsection{Computer Vision Module}

\subsubsection{YOLOv8 Implementation}

The vehicle detection system utilizes YOLOv8, the latest iteration of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection family. YOLOv8 was selected for its superior balance of detection accuracy and inference speed, critical for real-time traffic monitoring applications.

The detection pipeline processes video frames through the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Frame Preprocessing:} Input frames are resized to 640x640 pixels and normalized to match YOLOv8 training data distribution
\item \textbf{Object Detection:} YOLOv8 model processes frames to identify vehicle objects with confidence scores
\item \textbf{Confidence Filtering:} Detections below 0.5 confidence threshold are discarded to reduce false positives
\item \textbf{Non-Maximum Suppression:} Overlapping bounding boxes are filtered to eliminate duplicate detections
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hexagonal Clustering Algorithm}

To determine vehicle movement direction, the system implements a novel hexagonal clustering approach. This algorithm divides the detection area into six directional zones corresponding to traffic flow patterns:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{North:} Vehicles moving towards the top of the frame
\item \textbf{South:} Vehicles moving towards the bottom of the frame
\item \textbf{East:} Vehicles moving towards the right side
\item \textbf{West:} Vehicles moving towards the left side
\item \textbf{Northeast/Northwest:} Vehicles in diagonal movement patterns
\end{itemize}

The clustering algorithm calculates the centroid of each detected vehicle and maps it to the appropriate directional zone based on geometric position and movement vector analysis.

\subsubsection{Junction Orientation Handling}

Different camera orientations at traffic junctions require adaptive processing. The system implements orientation-specific transformations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Normal Junctions (01, 02):} Standard coordinate system with no geometric transformations
\item \textbf{Flipped Junctions (03, 04):} 180-degree rotation transformation applied to detection coordinates
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backend Service Architecture}

\subsubsection{FastAPI Framework}

The backend utilizes FastAPI, a modern Python web framework chosen for its high performance, automatic API documentation generation, and native support for asynchronous operations. Key architectural decisions include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Asynchronous Processing:} Non-blocking I/O operations for handling multiple concurrent requests
\item \textbf{Dependency Injection:} Modular service design enabling easy testing and maintenance
\item \textbf{Automatic Validation:} Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization
\item \textbf{Interactive Documentation:} Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation for API endpoints
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Microservices Communication}

The system employs two primary backend services:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Main Application Service (Port 8000):} Handles user authentication, dashboard data, and administrative functions
\item \textbf{Detection Service (Port 8002):} Dedicated computer vision processing and real-time vehicle counting
\end{enumerate}

Inter-service communication utilizes HTTP REST APIs with JSON payloads, ensuring loose coupling and independent scalability.

\subsubsection{Real-time Data Streaming}

Server-Sent Events (SSE) technology enables efficient real-time communication between backend services and frontend clients. The SSE implementation provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Persistent Connections:} Long-lived HTTP connections for continuous data streaming
\item \textbf{Automatic Reconnection:} Client-side reconnection logic for handling network interruptions
\item \textbf{Event Multiplexing:} Single connection handling multiple data streams (vehicle counts, signal status, emergency requests)
\item \textbf{Bandwidth Optimization:} 75\% reduction in network overhead compared to traditional polling methods
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adaptive Signal Control}

\subsubsection{Webster's Formula Implementation}

The system implements adaptive signal control based on Webster's formula for optimal cycle time calculation:

\begin{equation}
C = \frac{1.5L + 5}{1 - Y}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C$ = Optimal cycle time (seconds)
\item $L$ = Total lost time per cycle (seconds)
\item $Y$ = Critical flow ratio (sum of critical lane group ratios)
\end{itemize}

The critical flow ratio is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
Y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{v_i}{s_i}
\end{equation}

Where $v_i$ is the traffic volume for lane group $i$ and $s_i$ is the saturation flow rate.

\subsubsection{Real-time Optimization}

The signal control algorithm updates timing parameters every 30 seconds based on current vehicle counts from the detection system. The optimization process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Data Collection:} Aggregate vehicle counts from all directional zones
\item \textbf{Flow Rate Calculation:} Convert vehicle counts to flow rates (vehicles per hour)
\item \textbf{Critical Ratio Determination:} Identify the critical movement with highest flow ratio
\item \textbf{Cycle Time Optimization:} Apply Webster's formula with current traffic data
\item \textbf{Phase Distribution:} Allocate green time proportionally to traffic demand
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Frontend Development}

\subsubsection{React.js Architecture}

The frontend employs React.js 19.1.0 with TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development experience. The component architecture follows modern React patterns:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Functional Components:} Utilizing React hooks for state management and lifecycle events
\item \textbf{Context API:} Global state management for user authentication and system status
\item \textbf{Custom Hooks:} Reusable logic for SSE connections and data fetching

\caption{Admin Dashboard Interface showing real-time traffic monitoring capabilities}
\label{fig:admin_dashboard}
\end{figure}
